# git-warp

Run git against a remote that's only reachable through Cloudflare WARP.
Auto-connects WARP when the remote is unreachable, runs your git command,
then restores WARP to its previous state.

## The problem

Some git remotes — private or internal servers — only answer when you're
connected to [Cloudflare WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/).
When you're off WARP, `git push` / `pull` / `fetch` hangs and dies with
`Couldn't connect to server` or `Failed to connect ... port 443`.

Connecting WARP by hand before every git command (and remembering to turn it
back off) is tedious. `git-warp` does it for you, and only when needed.

## What it does

1. Figures out the remote host (from `GIT_WARP_HOST`; for `clone`, from the
   clone URL argument; for `push`/`pull`/`fetch`/`ls-remote`, from the **remote
   argument** in the command — e.g. `fetch gitlab dev` resolves the `gitlab`
   remote — looked up in the repo selected by any leading `git -C <path>`;
   otherwise from `git remote get-url origin`). Leading git global options
   (`-C <path>`, `-c <kv>`, `--git-dir`, …) are parsed the way git does, so
   `git-warp -C /path fetch gitlab dev` inspects the right repo.
2. If `host:port` is **already reachable**, it runs git and leaves WARP untouched.
3. Otherwise it runs `warp-cli connect`, waits until the port becomes reachable
   (up to `GIT_WARP_WAIT` seconds), then runs git.
4. On exit — success, git failure, or interruption — a `trap` **restores WARP
   to its entry state**: it disconnects only if WARP was off when you started,
   and leaves it connected if it was already on.

The exit code is git's own exit code, or `2` if WARP couldn't make the host
reachable in time.

## Install — one command

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pw-OpenCapsule/git-warp/main/install.sh | sh
```

This installs `git-warp`, `warp-run`, and the transparent-mode wrapper
`git-warp.plugin.sh` to `~/.local/bin` (override with `BINDIR=/usr/local/bin`;
make sure it's on your `PATH`) **and auto-activates transparent mode** — it
appends a `source <plugin>` line to your shell rc (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` /
`~/.profile`, chosen from `$SHELL`; idempotent, never duplicated). **Restart
your terminal** (or `source` the rc as prompted) and a plain `git push` will
auto-route through WARP whenever the remote is unreachable.

> Don't want the installer touching your rc? Pass `--no-activate` (or set
> `GIT_WARP_NO_ACTIVATE=1`) — see [the fallback below](#without-changing-your-shell-manual-activation).

### As an agent skill

```sh
npx skills add pw-OpenCapsule/git-warp -y -g
```

This installs git-warp only as an agent skill (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex /
Gemini CLI). It **does not edit your shell or activate transparent mode** — it's
for an agent runner to call `git-warp` / `warp-run` explicitly.

## Usage — transparent mode (auto-activated)

The one-line install already activated transparent mode for you, so after
restarting your terminal your everyday commands transparently route through WARP
when needed:

```sh
git push
git pull
git fetch --all
git clone https://your-internal-host/group/repo.git
```

The wrapper only intercepts the **network** subcommands (`push`, `pull`,
`fetch`, `clone`, `ls-remote`, and `remote update`). Every other subcommand
(`commit`, `status`, `add`, `log`, `diff`, …) is passed straight through to the
real git with **zero added behavior or latency**. And because `git-warp` only
manages WARP for hosts in the allowlist (`GIT_WARP_ALLOW_HOSTS`, default
`sg-git.pwtk.cc`), every other remote (`github.com`, `gitlab.com`, …) is run
through plain git untouched — even when it's unreachable from your network — so
only the internal remote triggers the auto-connect.

### Without changing your shell (manual activation)

Install with `--no-activate` (or `GIT_WARP_NO_ACTIVATE=1`) to keep the installer
out of your rc:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pw-OpenCapsule/git-warp/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --no-activate
```

Then, when you want it, add the line yourself (the installer prints it):

```sh
# add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc:
source ~/.local/bin/git-warp.plugin.sh
```

Or skip sourcing entirely and call `git-warp` directly — it takes the exact
arguments you'd give `git`:

```sh
git-warp push origin main
git-warp pull
git-warp fetch --all
git-warp clone https://your-internal-host/group/repo.git
```

### Batch scripts: connect WARP once

If a script loops over many `git-warp fetch` calls, wrap the whole script with
`git-warp batch`. It connects WARP once when needed, runs the command, and then
restores WARP to its entry state. Any nested `git-warp` calls see the target
host as already reachable, so they do not connect/disconnect WARP for every
single repository.

```sh
git-warp batch --host sg-git.pwtk.cc -- ./scripts/update_repos.sh
```

You can also provide the host via the existing environment variable:

```sh
GIT_WARP_HOST=sg-git.pwtk.cc git-warp batch -- ./scripts/update_repos.sh
```

## Other commands (not just git)

Other commands that need the internal network — opening a PR, calling an
internal API — can use the same WARP logic via `warp-run`: it brings WARP up
when the target host is unreachable, runs your command, then restores WARP.

```sh
# open a PR
warp-run tea pr create --base main --head feature ...
warp-run glab mr create ...

# call an internal API
warp-run curl https://your-internal-host/api/...
```

`warp-run` has **no default host** — set `WARP_HOST` (or reuse `GIT_WARP_HOST`):

```sh
export WARP_HOST=your-internal-host
```

### Automate: make these commands auto-route through WARP too

Add the command names to `WARP_WRAP_CMDS` (space-separated) in your shell rc.
The plugin then defines a same-named shell function for each that routes it
through `warp-run`, so you keep typing the command as usual:

```sh
export WARP_HOST=your-internal-host
export WARP_WRAP_CMDS="tea glab"
source ~/.local/bin/git-warp.plugin.sh
```

Now `tea pr create ...` / `glab mr create ...` auto-connect WARP just like git
does. `WARP_WRAP_CMDS` is empty by default — nothing extra is wrapped unless you
opt in.

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GIT_WARP_HOST` | inferred from the remote arg / `origin` | git-warp target host to probe / route through WARP |
| `GIT_WARP_ALLOW_HOSTS` | `sg-git.pwtk.cc` | **Allowlist** of host patterns (comma/space-separated, shell globs, e.g. `"sg-git.pwtk.cc *.pwtk.cc"`) that git-warp manages WARP for. Any other host (or one that can't be determined) is run through plain git with WARP untouched. Set to `*` to manage every host (old behavior); an explicit `GIT_WARP_HOST` always bypasses it |
| `GIT_WARP_PORT` | `443` | Port to probe for reachability |
| `GIT_WARP_WAIT` | `40` | Seconds to wait for WARP to make the host reachable |
| `GIT_WARP_DEBUG` | unset | When set (e.g. `1`), print the resolved subcommand / remote / host and exit **without** touching WARP or git — for testing host inference |
| `git-warp batch --host <host> -- <cmd>` | none | Batch mode: keep one WARP scope around a whole command, useful for multi-repo sync scripts |
| `WARP_HOST` | none (falls back to `GIT_WARP_HOST`) | warp-run target host; if neither is set, warp-run errors out |
| `WARP_PORT` | `443` (falls back to `GIT_WARP_PORT`) | Port warp-run probes |
| `WARP_WAIT` | `40` (falls back to `GIT_WARP_WAIT`) | Seconds warp-run waits for WARP |
| `WARP_WRAP_CMDS` | empty | Extra command names to wrap transparently (space-separated, e.g. `"tea glab"`), routed through `warp-run` |

Host resolution order: `GIT_WARP_HOST` wins; for `clone` the host is parsed
from the clone URL on the command line (there's no `origin` yet); for
`push`/`pull`/`fetch`/`ls-remote` the host comes from the **remote argument**
in the command (`fetch gitlab dev` → the `gitlab` remote), looked up in the
repository selected by any leading `git -C <path>` global options; with no
positional remote (e.g. `fetch --all`, `remote update`) or an unknown one it
falls back to `origin`. Leading git global options (repeated `-C <path>`,
`-c <kv>`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`, …) are parsed the way git itself does,
so dropping `git-warp` in front of a `git -C /path -c … fetch <remote>` command
resolves the host from the right repo and remote. Set `GIT_WARP_HOST` to
override.

## Behavior notes

- **Already reachable → WARP untouched.** If the host answers without WARP,
  git-warp won't connect or disconnect anything.
- **State is restored via `trap`.** Even if git fails or you Ctrl-C, WARP returns
  to how it was on entry: off stays off, on stays on.
- It never disconnects a WARP session it didn't open.
- **Transparent mode only wraps network subcommands.** The `git()` shell
  function routes `push`/`pull`/`fetch`/`clone`/`ls-remote`/`remote update`
  through `git-warp` and passes everything else straight to the real git. It
  uses `command git` internally to avoid recursing into itself.

## Requirements

- [`warp-cli`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/) — the Cloudflare WARP client
